# Project

This is my project for the Sprint 6

The project for this sprint is to make an application, a tool to simulate random events, and the methods and libraries used to implement it.

I was using two application for making the online application - Visual Code in order to create Jupyter Notebook and Spyder through Anaconda Navigator for writing actual code. 

Code itself consists of: 
1. Importing necessary modules that will be useful in the future
2. Several tables
3. Histogram
4. 2 scatterplots
5. A filtering option
6. 2 scatterplots that will work with an above filter

In order to be able to use it, all you need to do is to run 'Sprint 6 Project.py' file in any app that can run python code. After that, you will receive the message in the console of that app you chose 'streamlit run /Users/sergeymedvedev/Downloads/Sprint 6 Project.py'
After that, all you need to do is to open the console in your computer, past this code and run it.
